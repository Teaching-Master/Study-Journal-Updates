# Learning Targets

This is a process which repeats for each prototype, by the end of the class you should be able to:
* Create a new Git repository for an existing Unity project (and if you can do it for a Unity project, you should be able to do it for any existing body of code that you want to manage with Git).
* Summarize and commit your changes.
* Create a new branch.
* Publish your work by pushing to GitHub.

without needing to refer to the slides or your notes.
