# Webb's Depth of Knowledge & Computer Science

The levels represent increasing complexity (and similarity to real-world problems). The level of a task describes the complexity of the thinking involved - not the "difficulty" of the task.

## Level 1: Recall & Reproduction

Recall facts, definitions of terms, "simple" concepts, and other foundational information. Recognize and follow routine procedures or patterns.

***What is the knowledge?***

At this level, the student either knows the answer, or they do not. These are not problems to be "figured out" or "solved." At this level we want to know if the student has a solid foundation in basic concepts and vocabulary.

Demonstrate a familiarity with the essential vocabulary and concepts involved with the tasks at this stage of the process. Mastery at this level means that you are able to follow a description of a task or an explanation of a concept or solution to a problem.

There is one correct answer which is not debatable. Level 1 tasks have minimal complexity.

Demonstrate knowledge of:
* Vocabulary
* Definitions
* UI elements

### Examples of Products and Assessments

* Correctly follow a detailed tutorial.
* Execute processes that have been previously taught.

## Level 2: Working With Skills & Concepts

Make decisions about how to approach a problem.

***How can the knowledge be used?***

Tasks require knowledge beyond basic definitions, and may require multiple steps or choosing between approaches -- but the focus is on solving familiar, typical problems. For example recognizing that the task requires a loop, and then choosing a construct and deciding how to control the loop. At this level relationships between concepts become important. Problems still have a "right" answer.

Following a general recipe - one that assumes considerable knowledge.

### Examples of Products and Assessments

## Level 3: Short-term Strategic Thinking

Develop a plan or series of steps to solve complex problems.

***Why can the knowledge be used?***

### Examples of Products and Assessments

## Level 4: Extended Strategic Thinking

Integrate knowledge for multiple sources -- make connections to solve real-world problems in original ways.

At this level there are multiple approaches and possible solutions. There is not a single correct answer. Experimentation and testing may be required to evaluate possible solutions.

Tasks require complex reasoning, planning, and thinking during execution -- these must be sustained over an extended period of time. Execution of the tasks require multiple steps and requires integrating concepts from within the course and across content areas.

***What else can be done with the knowledge?***

### Examples of Products and Assessments

* Open ended projects:
  - CWC personal project
  - WA State showcase
  - Community project
