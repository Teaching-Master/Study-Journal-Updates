### CT: Computational Thinking
* CT.L2:1 - Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g., problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instances, design, implementing a solution, testing and evaluation).
* CT.L2:12 - Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub problems.
* CT.L2:3 - Define an algorithm as a sequence of instructions that can be processed by a computer.
* CT.L3A:1 - Use predefined functions and parameters, classes and methods to divide a complex problem into simpler parts.
